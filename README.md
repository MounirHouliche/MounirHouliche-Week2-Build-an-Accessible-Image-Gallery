# MounirHouliche-Week2-Build-an-Accessible-Image-Gallery

What requirements did you achieve?

Implemented responsive design that works on small screens and desktop.
Added a clear media query (≥ 800px) so the desktop view looks noticeably different (larger thumbnails).
Ensured all images have meaningful alt text for accessibility.
Used event handlers so users can switch images by clicking thumbnails and using the Next/Previous buttons.
Made the selected image fill the page as a background, with thumbnails centered at the top and buttons underneath.


Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

I didn’t implement the optional keyboard navigation (e.g., Arrow keys / Enter on thumbnails).
I didn’t add extra ARIA attributes (like role, aria-live, or aria-current) this time.

If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

Understanding how to manipulate the DOM (creating elements with JS, clearing containers, and appending children) took a bit of practice.
Laying out the page so thumbnails are centered at the top with the image as a full-screen background required a few tries in CSS.
File paths (when using local images) were confusing at first—I learned to use relative paths from index.html and to check the console for 404s.
Had difficulties understanding function at some points, had to rely on Youtube and ChatGpt to explain a little bit.
